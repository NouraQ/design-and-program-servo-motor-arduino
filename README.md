# design-and-program-servo-motor-arduino
This project entails designing and programming an electrical circuit for a motor to implementing it for the robot arm.
The first task, Bring the breadboard, Arduino, and the five Servos. Then connect the ground in the servo, plug it into the breadboard's negative part, and plug the power into the positive part. The signal will be connected with the Arduino plug it with DIGITAL (PMW~) (~11,~10,~9,~6,~5), you can't use digital-like 0-1 because you won't get a number with a range of 1-180. Finally, connect the positive part of the board to the Arduino's 5V and the negative part to the Ground (GND). The second task, like the first task equipment plus five potentiometers. Begin by connecting the servos as before, then connect the potentiometer by plugging terminal1 into the negative part, then plugging the wiper into the ANALOG IN (AO, A1, A2, A3, A4), and finally plugging terminal2 into the positive part. After finish connecting, I program the first circuit to move the motor to 90 degrees. Then I program the second circuit to move the motor by using a potentiometer.
